# Workday Scheduler

For this project my job was to create a working scheduler for users to organize their workday. 

My thought process behind this project was to make this easy for users to schedule their days. 

# Screenshots
Within my js file I went with const, if and else statements. This way I created the rowimes and when users input a event at a specific time they can save it. The code also functions where if the time passes it will automatic grey out the past hour. As well when it came to styling I utilize bootstrap for styling.

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
WHEN I open the planner
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
WHEN I scroll down
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
WHEN I click into a timeblock
THEN I can enter an event
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved events persist
```
